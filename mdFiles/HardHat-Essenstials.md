# Hardhat Essentials ([ref](https://hardhat.org/tutorial))

## 1. Creating a new Hardhat project

```bash
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial

npm init

npm install --save-dev hardhat

npx hardhat init
```

## 2. Hardhat's architecture
Hardhat is designed around the concepts of tasks and plugins.

### 2.1 Tasks
To see the currently available tasks in your project, run:

```bash
# List available tasks
npx hardhat

# Compile the smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run the tests
npx hardhat test
```

### 2.2 Plugins
Hardhat is unopinionated in terms of what tools you end up using, but it does come with some built-in defaults. All of which can be overridden. Most of the time the way to use a given tool is by consuming a plugin that integrates it into Hardhat.

```bash
# Install the recommended plugin
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

Add this line to the top of your `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
```

## 3. Writing tests
* Contracts live inside a folder called `contracts`.
* Tests live inside a folder called `test`.


```js
const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();
```

=> Here we're getting a list of the accounts in the node we're connected to, which in this case is Hardhat Network, and we're only keeping the first one.

**NOTE**: Test setups can be re-used with `fixtures`.

## 4. Debugging with Hardhat Network
When running your contracts and tests on Hardhat Network you can print logging messages and contract variables calling console.log() from your Solidity code. To use it you have to import hardhat/console.sol in your contract code.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Token {
    // ...
    // Using console.log() inside a Solidity contract
    console.log(
        "Transferring from %s to %s %s tokens",
        msg.sender,
        to,
        amount
    );
    // ...
}
```

## 5. Deploying to a live network
Deployments are done through `HardHat Ignition`. 

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Token.js --network sepolia
```

## 6. Verify on Etherscan

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Lock.ts --network sepolia --verify
```
